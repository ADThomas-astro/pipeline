{"name":"PyWiFeS","tagline":"The Python data reduction pipeline for the WiFeS integral field spectrograph.","body":"### Introduction ###\r\n\r\nThis is the other homepage of PyWiFeS, a Python-based pipeline for reducing data from the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS).\r\n\r\nAn overview of the instrument itself can be found on its [RSAA webpage](http://rsaa.anu.edu.au/observers/observing-rsaa/wifes-information-observers) and further details about instrument configurations and observing can be found on the [WiFeS Wiki](http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/ssowiki/index.php/2.3m_WiFeS).\r\n\r\nAs of May 2015, the pipeline documentation will be gradually transfered from the initial [pywifes wiki](http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/pywifes/doku.php?id=start) to these pages.\r\n\r\n### Downloading PyWiFeS ###\r\n\r\nFrom version 0.7.1 of PyWiFeS, we have migrated the code to a Github repository. The latest release can be found here: https://github.com/PyWiFeS/pipeline/releases/latest\r\n\r\nNote that you do NOT need to install git or create a Github account to download the code.\r\n\r\n### ​Installing PyWiFeS ###\r\n\r\n1) After downloading PyWiFeS, unzip the archive and save its content anywhere you like.  \r\n2) Add the 'src/' subdirectory to your PYTHONPATH\r\n\r\nAnd voilà ! To test that it all went according to plan, start a new Python shell, and try to import PyWiFeS. It should not return any errors (you can/should also make sure that you are running the latest PyWiFeS) :\r\n\r\n    In [1]: import pywifes\r\n    In [2]: pywifes.__version__\r\n    Out[2]: '0.7.2'\r\n\r\n>_Note to pre-v0.7.1 PyWiFeS users:_  \r\n>\r\n>Prior to v0.7.1, installing PyWiFeS required the definition of the global variable \"PYWIFES_DIR\". This is **NOT** the case anymore. If you are updating to v0.7.1 or above and have previously defined \"PYWFIES_DIR\", you can a) update the definition of \"PYWIFES_DIR\" accordingly or b) remove the definition of \"PYWIFES_DIR\" altogether (recommended).\r\n\r\n### Acknowledging PyWiFeS ###\r\n\r\nWe now have a published paper on PyWiFeS. If you used it in your research, please cite: \r\n\r\n[Childress, Vogt, Nielsen, & Sharp (2014), ApSS, 349, 617](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014Ap%26SS.349..617C)\r\n\r\nand save yourself a 2-page data reduction description in your articles !  \r\n\r\nIf you use WiFeS data in your research, be sure to cite the Dopita+ instrument papers in your articles:\r\n\r\n[Dopita et al. (2007), ApSS, 310, 255](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007Ap%26SS.310..255D)  \r\n[Dopita et al. (2010), ApSS, 327, 245](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010Ap%26SS.327..245D)\r\n\r\n### Support ###\r\n+Mailing List:\r\n    There is a PyWiFeS mailing list (pywifes@mso.anu.edu.au) for users to discuss general issues. The list and also serves as the announcement platform for new code updates. To be added to this list, please contact Jon Nielsen (jon.nielsen@anu.edu.au).\r\n\r\n+Error Reporting:\r\n    We are working on a ticketing system to track code errors. In the meantime, please a) [raise an issue on Github](https://github.com/PyWiFeS/pipeline/issues) (preferred) or b) email the PyWiFeS mailing list to report any bugs.\r\n\r\nYou can see a list of known bugs/planned features [here](https://github.com/PyWiFeS/pipeline/issues).\r\n\r\n### The PyWiFeS Team ###\r\n\r\nPyWiFeS was primarily developed in 2012-2013 by:\r\n\r\nMichael Childress (michael.childress@anu.edu.au)  \r\nFrédéric Vogt (frederic.vogt@anu.edu.au)  \r\nJon Nielsen (jon.nielsen@anu.edu.au)  \r\nRob Sharp (robert.sharp@anu.edu.au)  \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
